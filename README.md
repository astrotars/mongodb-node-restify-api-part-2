# Part 2: Introducing Mongoose to Your Node.js and Restify API

In part-2, we'll integrate Mongoose, a massively popular ODM for MongoDB. Mongoose provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model your application data. It includes built-in type casting, validation, query building, business logic hooks and more, right out of the box. In addition to Mongoose, weâ€™ll also convert the original codebase to use ES6 standards with Babel, the go to compiler for writing next generation JavaScript.
